Designed for ease of use, robustness and low-cost, the “Openspritzer” is an open hardware “Picospritzer” as routinely used
in biological labs around the world. The performance of Openspritzer and commercial alternatives is effectively indistiguishable.

The system is based on a solenoid valve connected to a pressure gauge. Control can be attained directly via an external TTL pulse
or internally through an Arduino set by a rotary encoder. The basic setup can be put together for 3-400€, or substantially less if you
are prepare to shop around.

We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working
in the life and physical sciences.

## A DIY opensource microinjector
Compared to similar commercial systems that can cost up to several thousand pounds, the cost of the fully equiped Openspritzer (~£350) makes it particularly attractive for those wishing to pursue cutting-edge techniaues in low ressource environments.

When connected to a standard micro-pipette via suitable pneumatic tubing, the device is capable of
delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems.



In this work,
we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using two-photon
fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over
delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in
a series of standard neurobiological applications.



First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise
amounts of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA to hippocampal neurons to elicit time- and
dose-precise excitatory and inhibitory responses, respectively. Second, we used Openspritzer to
deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. Viral transfection of hippocampal
interneurons with channelrhodopsin allowed for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal
circuitry with light. Finally, we successfully used Openspritzer to infect organotypic hippocampal
slice cultures with fluorescent Mycobacterium bovis bacilli. We anticipate that due to its high
performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in
the life and physical sciences.
